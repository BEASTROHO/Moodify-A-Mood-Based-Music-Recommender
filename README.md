# Moodify-A-Mood-Based-Music-Recommender
Moodify is a mood-based music recommender that analyzes user input using sentiment analysis and suggests playlists accordingly. Built with Flask and TextBlob, it offers a simple API to detect emotional tone and map it to music genres. Future updates will include Spotify integration and a React frontend.
